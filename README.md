## Student Management System
# Implemented a console-based student management system with three main user toles in the application: \
a) A student can log in to their account, view/add/drop courses, check their course schedule, and view grades;\
b) A professor can view course information they have, and view the student lists for these courses;\
c) An admin can view course/student/professor lists, and add/delete courses/students/professors\
Wrote unit tests (JUnit) for every non-trivial method
