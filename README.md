# CIT590_A_Student_Management_System
Implemented a console-based student management system with three main user toles in the application: a) A student can log in to their account, view/add/drop courses, check their course schedule, and view grades; b) A professor can view course information they have, and view the student lists for these courses; c) An admin can view course/student/professor lists, and add/delete courses/students/professors; wrote unit tests for every non-trivial public method
