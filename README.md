## Course Management System
Implemented a console-based course management system with three main user roles in the application: \
\
a) An employee can log in to their account, view/add/drop courses, check their course schedule, and view grades;\
b) A manager can view course information they have, and view the employee lists for these courses;\
c) An admin can view course/employee/manager lists, and add/delete courses/employee/manager.\
\
Wrote unit tests (JUnit) for every non-trivial method.
